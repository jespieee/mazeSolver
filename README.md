# mazeSolver

## Overview

mazeSolver is a Python-based project that implements Depth-First-Search to solve mazes programmatically. The project is designed to take an input maze, represent it as a grid, find the shortest path from the start to the finish, and use vizualization tools to see the algorithm in action!
